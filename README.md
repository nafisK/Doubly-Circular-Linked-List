# DoublyCircularLinkedList

This project was created of a Data Structures Class. I used repl.it for creating this project and tried to comment on all the steps I took to make the Doubly Circular Linked List possible. 

It uses a menu system to let the client select options to execute and then does everything using the functions and classes.
Two main classes were created to make this project possible. The node class (which could also be a struct) and the circular doubly linked list class. 

The node class contains the informations for each node and a pointer to the next node and the previous node. 
The cdlinkedlist class (Circular Doubly Linked List) contains a pointer to the starting location (head), an iterating pointer to move through the linked lists and functions do things to the list.

NOTE: No last or end pointer was created since I was asked to iterate throught the list each time
